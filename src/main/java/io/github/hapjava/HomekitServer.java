/**
 * The main entry point for hap-java. Creating an instance of this class will listen for Homekit

 * instance and port, however, that accessory may be a {@link #createBridge(HomekitAuthInfo, String,
 * String, String, String) bridge accessory} containing child accessories.
 *
 * <p>The {@link HomekitAuthInfo HomekitAuthInfo} argument when creating accessories should be an
 * implementation supplied by your application. Several of the values needed for your implementation
 * are provided by this class, specifically {@link #generateKey() generateKey}, {@link
 * #generateMac() generateMac}, and {@link #generateSalt()}. It is important that you provide these
 * same values on each start of your application or Homekit will fail to recognize your device as
 * being the same.
